							<h3>Our history</h3>
							<p class="text">
								For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most
								delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our first store
								in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand
								Market. People from all over the world fell in love with the
								soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...<br />
								<i>The store became a success in no time.</i><br /><br />
								In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's
								Pie Shop mover into a larger building. After receiving many
								requests, it became clear that our next step was making it
								possible to order pies from the comfort of your own home and
								from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of
								this: our very own webstore, making it possible to order
								Bethany's delicious pies whenever you fell like it!
