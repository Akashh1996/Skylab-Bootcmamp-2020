					<b>Our history</b>
				</h3>
				<div id="mainText">
					For many years, <b><strong>Bethany</strong></b> has been baking the
					most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our first store in
					Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market.
					People from all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes,
					heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...<br />
					<i>The store became a success in no time.</i><br /><br />
					In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie
					Shop mover into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it
					became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies
					from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You
					are now looking at the result of this: our very own webstore, making
					it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you fell like
					it!
