						<p>
							For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious
							pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels
							(Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People
							from all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly
							cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...
							<i>The store became a sucess in no time.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's
							Pie Shop moved into a larger building. After receiving many
							requests, it became clear that our next step was making it
							possible to order pies from the comfort of your own home and from
							anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this:
							our very own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's
							delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
